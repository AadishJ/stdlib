## Usage

```javascript
const everyInBy = require( '@stdlib/utils/every-in-by' );
```

#### everyInBy( object, predicate\[, thisArg ] )

Tests whether all properties (own and inherited) of an `object` pass a test implemented by a `predicate` function.

```javascript
function isPositive( v ) {
    return ( v > 0 );
}

const o = {
    'a': 1,
    'b': 2,
    'c': 3
};

const bool = everyInBy( o, isPositive );
// returns true
```

If provided an empty `object`, the function returns `true`.

```javascript
function isPositive(v) {
    return ( v > 0 );
}

const bool = everyInBy( {}, isPositive );
// returns true
```
