## Usage

```javascript
const strides2offset = require( '@stdlib/ndarray/base/strides2offset' );
```

#### strides2offset( shape, strides )

Returns the index offset which specifies the location of the first indexed value in a multidimensional array.

```javascript
let offset = strides2offset( [ 3, 2 ], [ 2, 1 ] );
// returns 0

offset = strides2offset( [ 3, 2 ], [ -2, 1 ] );
// returns 4
```

    const j = discreteUniform( 0, shape.length-1 );
    strides[ j ] *= ( randu() < 0.5 ) ? -1 : 1;
    const offset = strides2offset( shape, strides );
    console.log( 'arr[0][0][0] = %d', arr[ offset ] );
