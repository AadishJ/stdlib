## Usage

```javascript
const array2dtype = require( '@stdlib/wasm/base/array2dtype' );
```

#### array2dtype( array )

Returns the WebAssembly data type for a provided `array`.

```javascript
const Float64Array = require( '@stdlib/array/float64' );
const arr = new Float64Array( 10 );

const dt = array2dtype( arr );
// returns 'float64'
```

If provided an argument having "generic" or an unknown/unsupported [data type][@stdlib/array/dtypes], the function assumes that array values can be stored as double-precision floating-point numbers and returns `'float64'`.

```javascript
const dt = array2dtype( [] );
// returns 'float64'
```

## Examples

```javascript

const empty = require( '@stdlib/array/empty' );
const array2dtype = require( '@stdlib/wasm/base/array2dtype' );

// Get a list of supported array data types:
const dt = dtypes();

// For each supported data type, create an array and return its WebAssembly data type...
for ( let i = 0; i < dt.length; i++ ) {
    const v = array2dtype( empty( 10, dt[ i ] ) );
    console.log( '%s => %s', dt[ i ], v );
}
