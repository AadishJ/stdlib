> Apply a unary callback to elements in an n-dimensional nested input array and assign results to elements in an n-dimensional nested output array.

## Usage

```javascript
const unarynd = require( '@stdlib/array/base/unarynd' );
```

#### unarynd( arrays, shape, fcn )

Applies a unary callback to elements in an n-dimensional nested input array and assigns results to elements in an n-dimensional nested output array.

```javascript
const abs = require( '@stdlib/math/base/special/abs' );

const x = [ [ -1.0, -2.0 ], [ -3.0, -4.0 ] ];
const shape = [ 2, 2 ];

// Compute the absolute values in-place:
unarynd( [ x, x ], shape, abs );
// x => [ [ 1.0, 2.0 ], [ 3.0, 4.0 ] ]
```

The function accepts the following arguments:

-   **arrays**: array-like object containing one input nested array and one output nested array.
-   **shape**: array shape.
-   **fcn**: unary function to apply.

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   The function assumes that the input and output arrays have the same shape.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
const discreteUniform = require( '@stdlib/random/base/discrete-uniform' ).factory;
const filledndBy = require( '@stdlib/array/base/fillednd-by' );
const zerosnd = require( '@stdlib/array/base/zerosnd' );
const abs = require( '@stdlib/math/base/special/abs' );
const unarynd = require( '@stdlib/array/base/unarynd' );

let shape = [ 3, 3 ];

let x = filledndBy( shape, discreteUniform( -100, 100 ) );
console.log( x );

let y = zerosnd( shape );
console.log( y );

unarynd( [ x, y ], shape, abs );
console.log( y );

shape = [ 3, 3, 3 ];

x = filledndBy( shape, discreteUniform( -100, 100 ) );
console.log( x );

y = zerosnd( shape );
console.log( y );

unarynd( [ x, y ], shape, abs );
console.log( y );
