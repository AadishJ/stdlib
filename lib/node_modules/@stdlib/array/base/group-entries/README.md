## Usage

```javascript
const groupEntries = require( '@stdlib/array/base/group-entries' );
```

#### groupEntries( x, groups )

Groups element entries as arrays associated with distinct keys.

```javascript
const x = [ 'beep', 'boop', 'foo', 'bar' ];
const groups = [ 'b', 'b', 'f', 'b' ];

const out = groupEntries( x, groups );
// returns { 'b': [ [ 0, 'beep' ], [ 1, 'boop' ], [ 3, 'bar' ] ], 'f': [ [ 2, 'foo' ] ] }
```

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   Each value in `groups` should resolve to a value which can be serialized as an object key. As a counterexample,

    ```javascript
    const x = [ 'beep', 'boop', 'foo', 'bar' ];
    const groups = [ {}, {}, {}, {} ];

    const out = groupEntries( x, groups );
    // returns { '[object Object]': [ [ 0, 'beep' ], [ 1, 'boop' ], [ 2, 'foo' ], [ 3, 'bar' ] ] }
    ```

    while each "group" is unique, all input array elements resolve to the same group because each group identifier serializes to the same string.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
const discreteUniform = require( '@stdlib/random/array/discrete-uniform' );
const take = require( '@stdlib/array/base/take-indexed' );
const groupEntries = require( '@stdlib/array/base/group-entries' );

// Define an initial array of values:
const values = [ 'beep', 'boop', 'foo', 'bar', 'woot', 'woot' ];

// Sample from the initial array to generate a random collection:
const indices = discreteUniform( 100, 0, values.length-1, {
    'dtype': 'generic'
});
const x = take( values, indices );
// returns [...]

// Randomly assign collection values to groups:
const groups = discreteUniform( x.length, 0, values.length, {
    'dtype': 'generic'
});

// Group the values:
const out = groupEntries( x, groups );
// returns {...}

console.log( out );
```
