## Usage

```javascript
const quinary2d = require( '@stdlib/array/base/quinary2d' );
```

#### quinary2d( arrays, shape, fcn )

Applies a quinary callback to elements in five two-dimensional nested input arrays and assigns results to elements in a two-dimensional nested output array.

```javascript
const add = require( '@stdlib/math/base/ops/add5' );
const zeros2d = require( '@stdlib/array/base/zeros2d' );

const x = [ [ 1.0, 2.0 ], [ 3.0, 4.0 ] ];
const out = zeros2d( [ 2, 2 ] );

const shape = [ 2, 2 ];

quinary2d( [ x, x, x, x, x, out ], shape, add );
// out => [ [ 5.0, 10.0 ], [ 15.0, 20.0 ] ]
```

The function accepts the following arguments:

-   **arrays**: array-like object containing five input nested arrays and one output nested array.
-   **shape**: array shape.
-   **fcn**: quinary function to apply.

## Notes

-   The function assumes that the input and output arrays have the same shape.

```javascript
const discreteUniform = require( '@stdlib/random/base/discrete-uniform' ).factory;
const filled2dBy = require( '@stdlib/array/base/filled2d-by' );
const zeros2d = require( '@stdlib/array/base/zeros2d' );
const add = require( '@stdlib/math/base/ops/add5' );
const quinary2d = require( '@stdlib/array/base/quinary2d' );

const shape = [ 3, 3 ];

const x = filled2dBy( shape, discreteUniform( -100, 100 ) );
console.log( x );

const y = filled2dBy( shape, discreteUniform( -100, 100 ) );
console.log( y );

const z = filled2dBy( shape, discreteUniform( -100, 100 ) );
console.log( z );

const w = filled2dBy( shape, discreteUniform( -100, 100 ) );
console.log( w );

const v = filled2dBy( shape, discreteUniform( -100, 100 ) );
console.log( v );

const out = zeros2d( shape );
console.log( out );

quinary2d( [ x, y, z, w, v, out ], shape, add );
console.log( out );
```
