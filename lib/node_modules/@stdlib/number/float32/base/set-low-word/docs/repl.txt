{{alias}}( x, low )
    Sets the less significant 32 bits of a single-precision floating-point
    number.

    Setting the lower order bits of `NaN` or positive or negative infinity will
    return `NaN`, as `NaN` is defined as a single whose exponent bit sequence is
    all ones and whose fraction can be any bit sequence except all zeros.
    Positive and negative infinity are defined as singles with an exponent bit
    sequence equal to all ones and a fraction equal to all zeros. Hence,
    changing the less significant bits of positive and negative infinity
    converts each value to `NaN`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: number
        Input value.

    low: integer
        Unsigned 32-bit integer to replace the lower order word of `x`.

    Returns
    -------
    out: number
        Single having the same higher order word as `x`.

    Examples
    --------
    > var low = 5 >>> 0;
    > var x = 3.14e20;
    > var y = {{alias}}( x, low )
    7.006492321624085e-45

    // Special cases:
    > var low = 12345678;
    > var y = {{alias}}( {{alias:@stdlib/constants/float32/pinf}}, low )
    NaN
    > y = {{alias}}( {{alias:@stdlib/constants/float32/ninf}}, low )
    NaN
    > y = {{alias}}( NaN, low )
    NaN
